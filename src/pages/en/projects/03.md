description: >-
   A villa by the sea. This project consists of a ground-floor bungalow, located by the seaside. The colourings applied are rather of light, creamy hues with the addition of marble and travertine and a bot of detail in the shape of tall, adorning grass. The project is designed to be a subtle one, and the colourings soft so that it wouldn't take away from the marine surroundings which can be seen through the big windows. It's rather a weekend house which serves as a treat from the strenuous urban life. Clients that have visited this project wanted to it to feel like a SPA. The master bedroom has been assorted with a big, stone bath. Every wardrobe has been placed within the walls so that they remain obfuscated in the form of alcoves. An additional element to the interior is an array of paintings, perfectly matching this interior, titled "Texture", designed exclusively for this kind of interior on order of our investors. The paintings are prepared by Ma≈Çgorzata herself.
