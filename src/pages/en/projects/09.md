  Interiors of a 150-meter single-family house. The assumption was to use plywood, resin screed, bleached oak and natural earthy colors. The additions that enliven the space are rust and brick materials and Alcantara. We used natural stone with strong veins to add character. The whole has a fairly calm character, despite the use of bold forms. In addition, custom-made lamps, including plywood, were designed. The whole interior transmits light from one side of the house to the other.
  We have kept exposed structural beams and made them an asset. The layout of the rooms was thought out and arranged in such a way that the living area and kitchen were on the south side. The bedroom is located from the east. However, a room with a reading room on the west side.
