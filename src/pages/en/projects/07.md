  The project of an apartment located in a tenement. Ceilings are aloft and the classical adornments, typical of places from this epoch, are base for further project efforts. We relish in projects of nature like this one and we love bestowing upon them a completely new character. We decided on scraping the herringbone parquet, which had been preserved in good condition. Our main aim as regards this project was to keep the whole space as light as possible, which gives the optical illusion that the whole space is even bigger than it is. The abundance of sculptures, vases and other accessories has been adjourned from the previous client's flat. The space arrangement and stylisation resulted in a very eye-pleasing effect. It's a great example of how devoting oneself to arranging the space and omitting some (unnecessary) materials can divulge the interior space's character once again.
