  An apartment in Szczyrk - stylisation of this venue is in accordance with the mountain surroundings but simultaneously merged with modern style. The main feature of this project is its functionality and versatility, decent illumination and enthralling conception. We have used an interesting combination of walnut wood with lustreless inkiness and detail in the shape of copper fronts. Kitchen area with a day area leads to a garden with a view of the Skrzyczne Mountain. Bedrooms have analogical design and are secluded from the main area of the apartment.
