  A flat in Cracow. The space of this project is rather small, intended mainly for young people. The colourings - natural hues of verdure and other sandy hues. Wooden planks of dark colours with the expressive structure of wood have been used throughout the flat. Siting of the apartment required from us use of fairly light and soft colours because all the windows face the forecourt, which was a challenge.
