description: >-
  An apartment in Warsaw. Inherently, this project was aimed to have been of tenebrous colouring yet simultaneously accompanied with modern style. We have decided that our inspiration should be the Japan themes and materials used there. The semblance to Japan that we have striven to attain here is in use of dark fronts - mainly tan wood - Shou Sugi Ban. On account of the uncanny texture, the material looks utterly incredible and its visual advantage has been juxtaposed with flaxen oak wood and carvings on furniture's fronts - all of it gives an extraordinary fusion of Japan and modern style. Contrastively, the walls have been painted all white, and others - like for example the ones cleaving to bead-head or cleaving to the kitchen - have been lined with oak lining. The whole of it gives off a pleasant visual effect and the applied ergonomic solutions allowed to deploy a great number of cubbyholes, wardrobes and other cupboards on this less than 70 square meters area.
