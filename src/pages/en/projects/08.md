  The project of the apartment in Prague was a real stylistic challenge. With this project, as well as with the previous ones, we intended to keep the already present materials and reshape the space so that it would become a perfect abode for an art-loving elderly couple. The colouring - soft. All of the materials used here are wholly natural. Stone, wood, woven curtains and sundry linens/plain weaves (do sprawdzenia). This project executed gradually. Currently, we're in the phase of finalising and appending any amendments necessary.
