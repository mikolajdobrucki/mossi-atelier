  The main premise of designing was area disposal - the day area and night area - throughout two tiers. This house has quite an unusual form. The entrance is designed to be a small communicational area. A narrow stairwell leads the way to the first floor. The area on the first floor is significantly bigger than the ground floor. This area has been designed as a zone filled with reception rooms and a bathroom. The second floor is devoted to a kitchen consisting of an open day area merged with a dining area and a TV area - this part of the floor has the biggest surface area. The rest of the rooms on this floor are a secluded bedroom en-suite with a walk-in closet, and the master bathroom. The hues predominant within this construction are the monochromatic black and white but they are complemented with warm, wooden elements - European walnut and natural stone, the latter being located within the kitchen island. All the additional accessories are soft coloured. The main accents of the colouring in the space within the house are structures, textures and materials  and of course paintings.
